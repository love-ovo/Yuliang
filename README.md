Hi, I'm **Haopeng Deng**, and I created this clean, modern, and responsive academic homepage to present my resume, research achievements, and personal portfolio in a clear and efficient way.
📎 **[View Live Demo](https://qianyhp.github.io/)**  

## ✨ Features

- 🧱 **Clear Layout**: The homepage uses a responsive design with a two-column layout on desktop and a single-column layout on mobile, making content easy to scan.  
- 📌 **Sticky Navigation**: The top header and left sidebar (on desktop), which include personal info and contact details, are sticky to stay always visible.  
- 🎨 **Visual Enhancements**: Background images, smooth CSS animations, and image scroll containers improve the user experience.  
- 🛠️ **Easy Customization**: Built with plain HTML and CSS, with clean structure for easy maintenance and secondary development.
